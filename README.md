# From-Data-to-Insights :: The-Blueprint-for-SF-Bay-Area-Bicycle-Trip-Business

## Overview

The projects aims to find the new business insights from the business model from the 
dataset of people trip usage. The **purpose** of making trips differs from person 
to person and there are lot interesting insights to be delivered to customers,
to improved the service of the customers. 

As I focused to improve my data mining skills with respect to business model which 
is mandatory for any business. I tried to look at the dataset in a way that the
Business spoke person look at it to improve the business model. 

Intially, To choose a business model, I have choosen a well known kaggle dataset **SF Bay Area**
to understand the business model of SF Bay area bicycle management industry and found a reliable one.
The dataset was 90% clean where it has missing data and data duplication upto certain limit in 
the dataset, the data was preprocessed to removing the missing data in R and format it based on the
of model to becreated.

The dataset was well known and mined by different data scientists to find a lot of business 
insights and the behaviour of people to understand the data set model. Observing the diversity
of dataset model, I tried to experiment it with the well known data mining algorithms like
Apriori to map the idea proposed insight to be verified. 



## Challenges

- Managing Huge dataset
- Removing Outliers 
- practising other  data scientist kernels
- Computation time and energy
- Thinking in a way as Business Analyst
 
## Learnings

- Data Preparation & modelling
- Efficient way of data mining algorithm  implementation
- Very good study on Data science forum (Kaggle, Kdnuggets)
- View data as Business model to improve rather than just data
- Propose a story based on data
- SQLite and R Studio experience
- Figuring meaningful insights
- Way of thinking as a Business analyst and a data scientist (eg: Client & Service provider)
